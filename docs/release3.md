## **Working habits and task managment though release 3**
As we got back the feedback from release two we had to sit down and discuss how we could improve our teamwork. It is important for the project that we communicate well and work together as a group. 

For this release we have focused on a better planning phase. We used more time planning and discussing before we started working on the project. We felt that this really made the teamwork easier because we knew what the others where doing. We actively useed the assignee function in gitlab so there was no doubt who was in charge of the issue. 

We where also stricter with the reviewing of eachothers code when merging. As a security point we always reviewed each others work before merging it into the project. By leaving comments it was easier to go back and check up on the project.
